> What are the advantages and disadvantages of having a large fortune?

Every person dreams of being one of the lucky ones with a large fortune. Imagine if you could buy anything you wanted, travel anywhere you liked, and never had to work. However, this notion might not be as brilliant as it may seem at first glance. 

Possessing a large fortune offers a number of benefits. First of all, having more money means having more opportunities. For instance, in private clinics, the quality of services is higher and better than in public ones. Money gives you the opportunity to buy what you want, to help you achieve your goals. Second, having enough money can also make people feel confident about the future. A rich person doesn't have to worry so much about not being able to afford something. His life is free from financial troubles and anxiety about what the future holds. Moreover, a wealthy person can have a stable retirement plan and a chance to help his relatives make their dreams come true. In fact, a person who has enough money to provide a comfortable life for himself and his family can also donate money to charity, thus helping many people in need.  

On the contrary, a significant disadvantage of a large fortune is the attitude of others. Some people may ask for a loan and not return it. Relationships can be built on money, not on feelings. Other drawbacks of having a large fortune include fear of being robbed, lack of imagination regarding where to spend the money, and high taxes. Sadly, what may seem like a blessing at first can quickly turn into a burden. 

To sum up, it seems that in spite of a large number of disadvantages and a lot of responsibilities, having a large fortune makes life easier for people.

#### Sample Essay
> Some customers prefer conventional stores. Others prefer online shopping. Discuss both views and express your opinion.

Nowadays the retail industry has evolved beyond conventional shopping. While giant shopping centres, outlet malls and exclusive designer stores are still in high demand, more and more people prefer to shop online. The latter mode of shopping has seen an immense surge in popularity due to the coronavirus pandemic. Currently, some countries are lifting lockdown restrictions, which means that normal life can finally resume. However, it’s highly likely that many people will continue using shopping websites as opposed to actual shopping malls. 

To begin with, conventional shopping is far more tangible than online shopping. It’s much easier to find clothes and shoes that fit you best by trying them on. Additionally, sales assistants are always ready to lend a helping hand, consult a customer on the latest trends and even offer to alter certain outfits. On the downside, stores can be very crowded, especially around the holidays, and customers end up wasting their time, energy and emotions just to purchase a few items. 

In contrast, online shopping can be done from the comfort of your own home. You can browse local stores as well as international retailers, and shop for clothes, electronics, food, etc. all at once. Delivery can be swift and carried out in different ways: packages can be delivered to your door (sometimes at additional cost), as well as to satellite locations where you can pick them up at a convenient time. However, such deliveries can be very expensive, and packages could get delayed at customs. 

On the whole, it’s clear that each mode of shopping can be used by anyone depending on their current needs. Personally, I prefer online shopping for its convenience, the vast variety of products, and for the great deals that are constantly offered.
